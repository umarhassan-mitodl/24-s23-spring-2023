At the end of this course, you will make a poster presentation to the class and to the MIT Linguistics community about your work, how it could be developed, and how it could support the design of an introductory high school linguistics course. You can choose to present the lesson that you designed for your partner teacher’s class, the lesson that the class designed for Spring Spark, or your linguistics unit (see {{% resource_link "bfd54aef-c0e7-4124-803c-1f473f61f093" "Final Project" %}} page). The goal is to demonstrate and share what you have learned about course design, about teaching, and about what linguists need to know about introducing language science to K–12 students. Further details about the poster presentation will be discussed in class.

Poster presentations will take place during our last class. The MIT Linguistics community will be invited to attend.
