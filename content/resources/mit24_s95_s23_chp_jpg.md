  caption: 'Despite being spelled with an *s*, the plural ending on *schoolbuses*
    is pronounced with a /z/ sound rather than an /s/ sound. The rule that governs
    this pronunciation is part of the large database of linguistic information that
    speakers of English generally learn in early childhood without formal instruction.
    By later childhood, students can potentially use that database as the object of
    formal scientific inquiry. (Photo courtesy of {{% resource_link "a0d961a9-5534-420d-a169-8d1673597b34"
